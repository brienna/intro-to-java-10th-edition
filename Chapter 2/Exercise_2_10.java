/*  (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed to 
heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should 
prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final 
temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is

Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184

where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and 
energy Q is measured in joules. Here is a sample run:

Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5
Enter the initial temperature: 3.5
Enter the final temperature: 10.5
The energy needed is 1625484.0
